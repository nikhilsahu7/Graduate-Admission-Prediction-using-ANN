# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-ANN

This project demonstrates how to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to solve a regression problem, specifically predicting the chance of graduate admission based on various features such as GRE scores, university rankings, and recommendation letters.

### This project utilizes a dataset related to graduate admissions, where the goal is to predict the chance of admission for students applying to universities. The model is implemented using deep learning techniques, particularly focusing on regression problems with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about students who are applying to graduate programs and includes the following features:

- **GRE Score: The student's GRE exam score.**
- **University Rating: Rating of the university the student is applying to.**
- **Statement of Purpose: A measure of the student's SOP strength.**
- **Letter of Recommendation Strength: Strength of the student's LOR.**
- **Undergraduate GPA: The student's undergraduate CGPA.**
- **Research Experience: Whether the student has research experience.**
- **The target variable is the Chance of Admission, a value between 0 and 1.**
